# TODO

- switch Wikipedia article retrieval to HTML so we can filter out non-text sections (only leave sections dominated by <p> tags or somethiing)
X dynamically increase view radius based on the number of POIs in the area
X place marker balloons for next POI as soon as the playback for the last POI has finished
X evaluate other strategies for picking geodate tiles in front of the aircraft
/ higher resolution elevation data
- fix dynamic config (reprocess tiles on config change without hammering wikidata)
X frontend: Altitude box: show "valley altitude"
X frontend: show (optional?) AP status
X dynamic visibility boost: only for XL categories
X pick better thumbnails
X better prediction of how long it takes to generate a narrative
- make Phileas a male person (or make it configurable), give him a better and more intense default personality
X add a streaming switch to the UI so it keeps updating in the background
X expand blind spot to 360°
X OBS overlay
- add info about next city or town to script prompt, and find a good way to make use of it
- auto-update edge-tts user agent and key from locally installed Edge
X API counters for all LLMs
- fix beacon balloons hidden by terrain when flying parallel to high terrain
X support multiple screenshot paths (e.g. VR, pancake)
X feature: notification when crossing state or country borders, entering international waters, etc (new narrative type "remark"?)
- handle "area" POIs (like lakes, cities) better, also "length" POIs like rivers and roads
X control the config using transponder codes and ident
X build an frontend app that wraps the browser UI
- marker badges for interesting states (e.g. deferred)
