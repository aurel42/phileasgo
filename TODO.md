# TODO

- switch Wikipedia article retrieval to HTML so we can filter out non-text sections (only leave sections dominated by <p> tags or somethiing)
X dynamically increase view radius based on the number of POIs in the area
X place marker balloons for next POI as soon as the playback for the last POI has finished
- evaluate other strategies for picking geodate tiles in front of the aircraft
- higher resolution elevation data
- fix dynamic config (reprocess tiles on config change without hammering wikidata)
X frontend: Altitude box: show "valley altitude"
X frontend: show (optional?) AP status
- dynamic visibility boost: only for XL categories
