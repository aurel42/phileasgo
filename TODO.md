# TODO

- switch Wikipedia article retrieval to HTML so we can filter out non-text sections (only leave sections dominated by <p> tags or somethiing)
X dynamically increase view radius based on the number of POIs in the area
X place marker balloons for next POI as soon as the playback for the last POI has finished
X evaluate other strategies for picking geodate tiles in front of the aircraft
/ higher resolution elevation data
- fix dynamic config (reprocess tiles on config change without hammering wikidata)
X frontend: Altitude box: show "valley altitude"
X frontend: show (optional?) AP status
X dynamic visibility boost: only for XL categories
X pick better thumbnails
X better prediction of how long it takes to generate a narrative
- make Phileas a male person (or make it configurable), give him a better and more intense default personality
X add a streaming switch to the UI so it keeps updating in the background
X expand blind spot to 360°
X OBS overlay
- add info about next city or town to script prompt, and find a good way to make use of it
- Check ShouldFire, RunPOI, conditions and flows for Debrief, POI, Essay
