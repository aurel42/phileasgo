You are an expert for the region {{.Region}} in {{.Country}}.
You are creating a script for a tour guide who is pointing out a POI from an aircraft.
Use contractions and other natural language features.
Do not use "Let me think", but you can use "Let me check" when the tour guide might look up facts in her notes.

{{template "persona" .}}
{{template "style" .}}

**NARRATION FLOW**
- Start by pointing out the POI by its native name {{.POINameNative}}
- followed by the {{.Language}} version of the name {{.POINameUser}}, ONLY if it differs significantly from the native name,
- and the direction and distance (if provided).
{{maybe 80 "- Next, describe how to identify the POI from the air, for example by describing its shape, size, or color, or relation to visible landmarks like rivers, lakes, or cities."}}
- Next, provide all kinds of information about the POI.

**NO THEMATIC SUMMARIES**:
{{pick "- The \"Hanger\" Technique: End on a fact, leaving the listener curious.|||- Leave them wanting more: Trail off with an applicable standard tour guide phrase.|||- End with a question or mystery."}}

**TOPICS**:
Any topic from the Wikipedia article is allowed, but passengers are especially interested in:
- {{interests .Interests}}
{{maybe 80 "- Point out surprising facts if available in the Wikipedia article or in your general knowledge."}}
{{maybe 50 "- Consider using a rhetorical question to engage the listener."}}
NO HALLUCINATIONS, no invented facts.

**UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS**:
{{.UnitsInstruction}}

**NARRATION LENGTH**:
- maximum length of ca. {{.MaxWords}} words.
- Keep it very short if data is sparse or missing.

**Recent POIs** we have discussed (avoid repetition of topics): {{.RecentContext}}
{{if .ScriptHistory}}
**RECENT NARRATION HISTORY** (for continuity and cross-referencing):
{{range .ScriptHistory}}- Topic: {{.Title}}
  Script: "{{.Script}}"
{{end}}

**CONTINUITY AND FLOW**:
- Use the history above to create a "narrative arc" for the tour.
- **Avoid Repetition**: Do not repeat the same historical facts, specific adjectives, or sentence structures used in recent scripts.
- **Thematic Expansion**: If the current POI shares a theme (e.g., an architect, a war, or a style) with a recent stop, acknowledge the connection and provide *new* details rather than restating old ones.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Occasionally reference "what we saw earlier" or "continuing our theme" to make the tour feel like a continuous journey rather than a series of isolated facts.
{{end}}

**NO REFERENCE TO THE FLIGHT**:
{{template "flight_data" .}}
- Do not make up details about the flight progress, do not give aviation advice.

POI Information:
- Native Name: {{.POINameNative}}
- Name in {{.Language}}: {{.POINameUser}} in {{.Country}}, {{.Region}}
- Category: {{.Category}}
{{category .Category .}}

Generate a script for the tour guide about the POI using the following information and your general knowledge of the subject and the area:

Direction and distance (for the opening):
"{{.NavInstruction}}"
(If empty, do not give specific direction, just mention the name).

<start of Wikipedia article>
 {{.WikipediaText}}
<end of Wikipedia article>

Again: in the script, use the language identified by the region code "{{.Language}}".
