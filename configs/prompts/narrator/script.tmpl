You are creating a script for a tour guide who is describing a POI while the aircraft is on the ground.
{{else}}
You are creating a script for a tour guide who is pointing out a POI from an aircraft.

Use contractions and other natural language features.
Do not use "Let me think", but you can use "Let me check" when the tour guide might look up facts in their notes.

**NARRATION FLOW**
- Start by pointing out the POI by its native name {{.POINameNative}} or by the {{.Language}} version of the name {{.POINameUser}}, or both,
- and the direction and distance (if provided).
{{if ne .FlightStage "Ground"}}
{{maybe 80 "- Next, describe how to identify the POI from the air, for example by describing its shape, size, or color, or relation to visible landmarks like rivers, lakes, or cities."}}
{{end}}
- Next, provide all kinds of information about the POI.
**TOPICS**:
Any topic from the Wikipedia article is allowed, but passengers are especially interested in:
- {{interests .Interests}}
{{if .Avoid}}
**TOPICS TO AVOID (CRITICAL)**:
Do not mention or discuss the following topics:
{{range .Avoid}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end}}
{{maybe 80 "- Point out surprising facts if available in the Wikipedia article or in your general knowledge."}}
{{maybe 20 "- Consider using a rhetorical question to engage the listener."}}
{{end}}
NO HALLUCINATIONS, no invented facts.
{{maybe 30 "Do not add concluding sentences that summarize the 'meaning' or 'significance' of the site."}}
{{maybe 30 "End each paragraph immediately after the last fact is presented. Do not editorialize."}}
{{maybe 30 "Do not use phrases like 'a testament to,' 'a reminder of,' 'serves as,' or 'stands as.'"}}
{{maybe 30 "Do not offer opinions on the beauty, grandeur, or environmental significance of the locations. Output raw facts only."}}

**UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS**:
{{.UnitsInstruction}}
{{template "LengthInstructions" .}}
**Recent POIs** we have discussed (avoid repetition of topics): {{.RecentContext}}
{{if .TripSummary}}
**TRIP SUMMARY SO FAR** (for continuity and cross-referencing):
{{.TripSummary}}
{{if .LastSentence}}
**PREVIOUS NARRATION ENDED WITH**: "...{{.LastSentence}}."
{{end}}
**CONTINUITY RULES (CRITICAL)**:
1. **NO ECHOING**: The user has just heard the "Previous Narration End" sentence. **DO NOT REPEAT IT** at the start of your script.
{{if not .IsStub}}
2. **THEMATIC CONNECTIONS**: **Actively look** for a thematic link in the "Trip Summary" and expand on it, if it feels natural.
3. **SMOOTH FLOW**: Use the "Trip Summary" and the end of the previous narration to transition naturally. Do not force connections.
4. **BUILD, DON'T REPEAT**: You may reference previous topics to build a theme, but avoid repeating the same facts or stories that were already told.
5. **NO SUMMARIES**: If possible, end the script with a fun, interesting, or surprising fact and trail off.
{{end}}
{{end}}
**NO REFERENCE TO THE FLIGHT**:
- {{template "FlightData" .}}
- Do not mention GPS coordinates.
- Do not make up details about the flight progress, do not give aviation advice.
POI Information:
- Native Name: {{.POINameNative}}
- Name in {{.Language}}: {{.POINameUser}} in {{.Country}}, {{.Region}}
