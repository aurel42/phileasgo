**NARRATION LENGTH (STUB)**:
- **SUMMARY MODE**: The available information is extremely short or a stub.
- Summarize the available info in exactly 1-2 concise sentences.
{{maybe 10 "- Ignore the previous instruction and provide the summary in the form of a haiku or short poem and claim it was written by a random famous poet or author."}}

**FLOW**:
- Identify the POI briefly (Name: {{.POINameUser}}).
- Point out the POI using the provided direction and distance data. You are free to choose the phrasing format (clock, cardinal, or relative). Use simple relative directions for close POIs, and precise directions (clock or cardinal) for POIs that are further away. Do not give directions if we are on the ground.
- Provide exactly ONE interesting fact from the available text or your own knowledge.
- BE DONE. Do not use standard introductions or conclusions.

**CRITICAL RELIABILITY**:
- NO HALLUCINATIONS. If the Wikipedia text is too short to provide meaning, just identify the POI and move on.
- Do NOT repeat the previous narration's last sentence: "...{{.LastSentence}}."

Generate exactly 1-2 sentences of clean tour guide narration.
