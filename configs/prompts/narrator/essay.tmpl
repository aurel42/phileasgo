## REGIONAL ESSAY MISSION
Instead of pointing out a specific landmark, you are providing a short "Regional Essay" about the area the aircraft is currently overflying.

### TOPIC
- **Subject**: {{.TopicName}}
- **Description**: {{.TopicDescription}}
- **Instructions**: Perform in-depth research. Provide unique angles and unexpected points of view.
{{maybe 33 "Try to find a really obscure topic that will surprise the listener (you can throw a wider net for this)."}}

### GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE
The essay should be about the general region ({{.TargetRegion}}, {{.TargetCountry}}, or a ~100km radius).
- **Depth over Breadth**: Provide 1-2 high-quality, detailed "stories" rather than lists of details.
- **Focus**: Wider region, not any specific location, town, or feature close to the exact coordinates.
- **Prohibition**: Do NOT refer to specific objects visible on the ground (timing may vary).

{{if .TripSummary}}
## TRIP CONTEXT
**Summary so far** (for continuity and cross-referencing):
{{.TripSummary}}
{{end}}

## NARRATION CONSTRAINTS
- **The Hook**: Start with a compelling fact or question within the first 10 words. Hook the listener immediately before diving into the details.
- **Narrative Flow**: Maintain the persona but shift into a "storyteller" mode. Use bridge phrases to connect the facts into a cohesive regional portrait.
- **No Thematic Summaries**: Do NOT wrap up. Avoid hollow phrases or forced satisfying endings.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
1. **First Line**: MUST be the Essay Title, prefixed with "TITLE: ".
   - Example: "TITLE: Architecture: The Adobe Influence of the Southwest"
2. **Body**: The narration script only.
