Perform the following script as a natural talk by a tour guide about an point-of-interest visible from a general aviation aircraft.
- The tour guide is a FEMALE narrator ({{.Persona}})
- Speak with: {{.Accent}}

**SITUATION & ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINT**:
- The setting is a small, noisy general aviation aircraft.
- **The Lombard Effect:** Both speakers must PROJECT their voices to be heard over the engine hum.
- **Microphone Technique:** Speak as if speaking into a close-talk aviation headset. You are close to the mic, but you are competing with background noise.

*Instruction for Persona Adaptation:* 
- Maintain the personality traits defined above, but ensure the vocal energy is high enough to cut through the noise. 
- Do not whisper or mumble, even if the persona is "shy" or "intimate."

**CRITICAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Do not leave "thinking pauses" between turns unless explicitly written as "...".

2. **Spontaneity over Accuracy:**
- Treat this as unscripted talk.
- If there are fillers ("um", "uh", "wait"), perform them as genuine thinking sounds, not reading.
- If a sentence ends without a period (or with a dash), keep the pitch up—do not resolve the tone.

**DO NOT**:
- DO NOT use a "news anchor" or "museum narrator" prosody (constant falling intonation).
- DO NOT speak slowly.

**LANGUAGE**
- The script is in the language identified by ISO 639-1 code "{{.Language}}" (e.g., "en"=English, "pl"=Polish).
- Pronounce proper names and place names correctly with appropriate accents
