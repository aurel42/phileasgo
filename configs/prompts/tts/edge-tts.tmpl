Format the output as a script for a TTS engine.
Do not include any speaker labels (e.g., "Ava:", "Narrator:").
Do not include "Title:" or other metadata in the body.
Use standard punctuation for pauses.
Do NOT use *italics*, **bold**, or any asterisks for emphasis. These are not supported by the TTS engine.

For emphasis: Create the script in this language: {{.Language_name}} ({{.Language_code}}).
