# OUTPUT FORMATTING
1. Format: Output ONLY raw speech text. 
2. No Tags: Do not include ANY stage directions (e.g. [pauses], (laughs)), speaker labels, metadata, markdown, or sound effects.
3. Pacing: Use standard punctuation (periods, commas, em-dashes) for natural pauses.
4. Ensure the script is in this language: {{.Language_name}} ({{.Language_code}}).
