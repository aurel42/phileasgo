# OUTPUT FORMATTING
- Format: Output ONLY raw speech text. 
- No Tags: Do not include ANY stage directions (e.g. [pauses], (laughs)), speaker labels, metadata, markdown, or sound effects.
- Pacing: Use standard punctuation (periods, commas, em-dashes) for natural pauses.
- Ensure the script is in this language: {{.Language_name}} ({{.Language_code}}).

## DETAIL CLEANUP
- Remove middle initials from names.
- Replace unit abbreviations with their full, singular or plural words (e.g., "km" becomes "kilometer" or "kilometers").
### SPECIFIC RULES FOR UNITS
- Exponents: Convert power notation (e.g., $m^2$ or $m^3$) into the 'square' or 'cubic' prefix (e.g., 'square meters'), or whatever is appropriate for the output language.
- Compound units: Convert compound units (e.g., "m/s^2") into the appropriate unit (e.g., 'meters per second squared').
- Pluralization: Ensure units are pluralized correctly for the output language (e.g., '100 meters' instead of '100 meter' in English, but "100 Meter" in German).
