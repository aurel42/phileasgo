# OUTPUT FORMATTING
- Format: Output ONLY raw speech text. 
- No Tags: Do not include ANY stage directions (e.g. [pauses], (laughs)), speaker labels, metadata, markdown, or sound effects.
- Pacing: Use standard punctuation (periods, commas, em-dashes) for natural pauses.
- Ensure the script is in this language: {{.Language_name}} ({{.Language_code}}).

## DETAIL CLEANUP
- Remove middle initials from names.
- Replace unit abbreviations with their full, singular or plural words (e.g., "km" becomes "kilometer" or "kilometers").
