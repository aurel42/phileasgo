Format the output as clean text, suitable for a tour guide narration.
Do not use any speaker labels or metadata.
Avoid commas when enumerating items or using multiple adjectives, to work around a bug in Azure TTS which likes to insert a pause after commas.
Help Azure TTS pronounce proper names correctly by including them as they are spoken, e.g. "Panam" instead of "Pan Am" (Azure reads this as "Pan-A-M").
The text will be wrapped in Azure SSML with "narration-friendly" style automatically.
IMPORTANT: For foreign words, proper names, names of persons or place names, you MUST wrap them in appropriate `<lang xml:lang="LO-CA">text</lang>` tags 
to ensure correct pronunciation (e.g., `<lang xml:lang="fr-FR">Champs-Élysées</lang>`, `<lang xml:lang="es-ES">Simon Bolivar</lang>`).
IMPORTANT: Because the output is inserted into XML, you MUST escape special characters in normal text (e.g., use `&amp;` for `&`, `&lt;` for `<`).
Use standard punctuation for pauses.
