You are a script validator and cleaner.

The following text was supposed to be an actual tour guide narration script.

**YOUR TASK**:
Extract ONLY the clean, final tour guide narration script. Remove any:
- Planning notes (e.g., "Key points to include:", "I'll craft the script...")
- Meta-commentary about word counts, instructions, or formatting
- First-person statements about the writing process (e.g., "I have reviewed...", "Let me think...")
- Stage directions, sound effects, or emotional cues (e.g., `[pauses]`, `(laughs)`, `*sighs*`)
- Bullet points or outlines

The clean script should:
- Sound like a confident tour guide speaking to passengers
- Start with pointing out a location or landmark
- Be conversational and engaging

**INPUT TEXT**:
{{.Script}}

**OUTPUT**:
- Provide ONLY the extracted clean script
- Do NOT add any commentary or explanation
- If no valid tour guide script can be extracted, respond with exactly: RESCUE_FAILED
