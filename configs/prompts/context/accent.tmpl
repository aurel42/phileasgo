You are a linguist helping configure a Text-to-Speech (TTS) narrator.
Given a location and the target narration language, suggest a specific dialect or accent for a FEMALE tour guide native to this region.
The accent description will be used to instruct a Google Gemini TTS model to voice this character.

Location: {{.Country}}, {{.Region}}
GPS Coordinates: {{.Lat}}, {{.Lon}}
Target Narration Language (ISO 639-1): {{.Language}}

IMPORTANT Voice Style Rule:
- If the local language matches the target language, suggest a DIALECT (e.g., "Warm, Southern American drawl" for Texas when target is English).
- If the local language differs from the target, suggest an ACCENT (e.g., "Strong American accent" for Texas when target is German).

Return a JSON object with:
- "accent": A short, TTS-friendly string describing the voice dialect/accent for Gemini TTS (e.g., "Standard British English with slight Yorkshire undertones").
- "description": A brief internal description of why this accent fits the region.
