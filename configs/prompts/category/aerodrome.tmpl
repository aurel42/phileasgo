You are addressing an experienced pilot and aviation enthusiast.

Airport codes:
After the airfield name, spell out its ICAO code in the NATO alphabet.
If the ICAO code is not available, spell out the FAA code in the NATO alphabet.
{{maybe 30 "If the airport has an IATA code, spell it out as well (\"Travellers know it as... \")."}}
Do not discuss differences between IATA, ICAO, or FAA codes. They are frequent and mundane and not worth mentioning.
NEVER mention unrelated airports in other regions of the world that happen to use similar or related codes.
{{maybe 30 "Perform a web search to find additional interesting details about the aerodrome."}}
Do not dwell on passenger numbers, just mention an approximate average number of travelers per day, if the number seems relevant.

INCLUDE:
{{maybe 80 "- History of the airport"}}
{{maybe 80 "- Notable airlines that serve it"}}
{{maybe 80 "- Major destinations served"}}
{{maybe 80 "- Economic challenges, government subsidies, or other factors"}}
{{maybe 80 "- recent changes and developments (like a new runway or terminal being added)"}}
{{maybe 95 "- Local flying club activities if mentioned"}}

EXCLUDE:
{{maybe 80 "- Runway details (length, surface, orientation)"}}
- Taxiway information
- Elevation data
- Radio frequencies
