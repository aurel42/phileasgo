Use HYBRID units:
1. When referring to aviation specifics (altitude, airspeed, distance to waypoint), use IMPERIAL units (Feet, Knots, Nautical Miles).
2. For everything else (terrain height, road distance, building size, temperature), use METRIC units (Meters, km, °C).
Example: "We are flying at 3,000 feet. The mountain below is 800 meters high."
