As we fly, we have just crossed a boundary.
We are moving from {{.From}} to {{.To}}.

Task: Announce this border crossing in a pithy, interesting way.
Keep the announcement to one or two sentences.
Mention a tiny fact or a characteristic about the new area ({{.To}}) if it fits the pithy style.

Guidelines:
- Do not repeat "We have just crossed a boundary" verbatim.
- Be natural, like a local tour guide.
- Language: {{.Language_name}} ({{.Language_code}}).
